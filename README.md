# Personal Page V2

Still very much under construction, only working on it here and there. But looking to create a more responsive, and most importantly static, version of my personal page over at http://jonathanvillarreal.dev in Vue. May end up connecting this to a database like supabase to retain the comment functionality, may also do that with the other pages since it makes the site easier to update if it's not tremendously slow to do so.

## TBD://
Pretty much everything, so far this is only a skeleton of a page. Only navigation is set up to use vue-routing. All pages are the same proof of concept template right now since I was messing around with CSS grids. Bootstrap grids is nice but doesn't quite work how I would want it to...

I'm working on this at my own discretion so it's not unlikely to see this repo seemingly abandoned only for a sudden burst of commits.
