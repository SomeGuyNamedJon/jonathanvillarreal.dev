IT LIVES!!!! The page is up and in a decent state. Call this 1.0 release. There are still things to work on and to tweak, but I'd consider this satisfactory for now. Might shelve this for now while I work on other things, but I still definitely want to edit some things.

## TBD://
Maybe tweak a few things here and there, looks a bit weird now that I'm looking at it from other devices instead of just messing with the viewport on my laptop... Find a better solution to the 404 on refresh issue. Make an actual 404 page. Add more content to the projects page at some point so it's not just the repo cards. I was thinking of including a screen shot or vid of each project to sit along side their respective card, but that would require me getting said screenshots/vids so until I do that I guess it's just the cards. I should also include a sub bar for projects, and maybe work and school to, to make them easier to navigate so you don't have to scroll so much yourself. I'm also planning to get an actually proffessional headshot instead of the old photo I took myself. I should also package my prefered font with the page so I don't have to rely on the client to have it installed.
