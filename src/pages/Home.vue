        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Jon, an aspiring software engineer and recent university graduate. 
            I'm passionate about video games, cartoons, anime, and technology. I'm a Linux and FOSS fanatic.
            I grew up in San Antonio, TX. It's where I attained my education and spent most of my life.
            I've recently moved to California to live with my fianc√©e and her family. I'm looking towards
            joining the work force as a new developer. Always looking forward towards expanding my knowledge
            and eager to make a name for myself.
        </p>
