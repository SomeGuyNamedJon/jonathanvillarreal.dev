    "blurb":"Hi, I'm Jon, an aspiring software engineer and recent university graduate. I'm passionate about video games, cartoons, anime, and technology. I'm a Linux and FOSS fanatic. I grew up in San Antonio, Texas. It's where I attained my education and spent most of my life. I spent some time and California working as a test engineer for Panasonic Avionics. I'm looking towards joining the work force as a software developer. I have skills in fullstack web development, DevOps, game development, along with a solid understanding of the fundementals of computer science. I spent a lot of time programming in C in the quest for my degree. I'm quite a competent graphic designer if I do say myself. Before I decided to persue a degree in Computer Science I wanted to be an artist. Always looking forward towards expanding my knowledge and eager to make a name for myself."

    "title":"Bachelor's in Computer Science",
    "blurb":"I achieved my degree at the University of Texas at San Antonio. It was a pleasant experience and I feel as my education was well rounded. I mainly spent my time learning core fundementals of computer science such as Data Structures, Discrete Mathmatics, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems using lower level languages such as C and C++. For concepts that required greater abstraction such as Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns there was Java. I learned and worked with MySQL in quite a few classes, including one dedicated to databases. I also spent some time with Python in a few courses as well as Game Development using C# in Unity. My last two semesters where pretty exclusively spent doing web development with JS, PHP, HTML, and CSS, along with the odd framework. Other languages I touched briefly where Lisp, awk, BASH, and x86 assembly."

    "title":"My experience with Linux",
    "blurb":"Linux is a big part of my life. I first gained a fascination with the operating system in high school when I was trying to revive a hand-me-down laptop that orginally ran Windows Vista. After having to reinstall Vista several times because it would always result in an irrecoverable BSoD, I began looking for options and discovered Ubuntu. I believe it was release 11.04. I became obessed with the idea of a free alternative that allowed you do whatever with your system. Total freedom might come with the ability to break things, but I took it in stride. What really sold me was the customization options, not only within a given desktop environment, but what your desktop environment even was. Needless to say I spent a lot of time distro and environment hopping after that. I wanted to consume as much as I could, experience all the options out there. Nowadays I'm running EndeavourOS for my work and gaming machines configured using bspwm the tiling window manager."
