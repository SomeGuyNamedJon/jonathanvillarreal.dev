I'm passionate about video games, cartoons, anime, and technology. I'm a Linux and FOSS fanatic. I grew up in San Antonio, Texas. It's where I attained my education and spent most of my life. I've recently moved to California to live with my fianc\xE9e and her family. I'm looking towards joining the work force as a software developer. I have skills in fullstack web development, DevOps, game development, along with a solid understanding of the fundementals of computer science. I spent a lot of time programming in C in the quest for my degree. I'm quite a competent graphic designer if I do say myself. Before I decided to persue a degree in Computer Science I wanted to be an artist. Always looking forward towards expanding my knowledge and eager to make a name for myself."},{picture:"diploma.png",imgID:"diploma",title:"Bachelor's in Computer Science",blurb:"I achieved my degree at the University of Texas at San Antonio. It was a pleasant experience and I feel as my education was well rounded. I mainly spent my time learning core fundementals of computer science such as Data Structures, Discrete Mathmatics, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems using lower level languages such as C and C++. For concepts that required greater abstraction such as Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns there was Java. I learned and worked with MySQL in quite a few classes, including one dedicated to databases. I also spent some time with Python in a few courses as well as Game Development using C# in Unity. My last two semesters where pretty exclusively spent doing web development with JS, PHP, HTML, and CSS, along with the odd framework. Other languages I touched briefly where Lisp, awk, BASH, and x86 assembly."},{picture:"pfetch.png",imgID:"pfetch",title:"My experience with Linux",blurb:"Linux is a big part of my life. I first gained a fascination with the operating system in high school when I was trying to revive a hand-me-down laptop that orginally ran Windows Vista. After having to reinstall Vista several times because it would always result in an irrecoverable BSoD, I began looking for options and discovered Ubuntu. I believe it was release 11.04. I became obessed with the idea of a free alternative that allowed you do whatever with your system. Total freedom might come with the ability to break things, but I took it in stride. What really sold me was the customization options, not only within a given desktop environment, but what your desktop environment even was. Needless to say I spent a lot of time distro and environment hopping after that. I wanted to consume as much as I could, experience all the options out there. Nowadays I'm running EndeavourOS for my work and gaming machines configured using bspwm the tiling window manager."}];const y={data(){return{pageJSON:f}},methods:{cssVars(a){const{currentTarget:e}=a,s=e.getBoundingClientRect(),l=a.clientX-s.left,n=a.clientY-s.top;e.style.setProperty("--relative-x",l+"px"),e.style.setProperty("--relative-y",n+"px")}}},v={class:"content"},I={class:"flex-container"},b={class:"badge"},_=["src","id"],x={key:0};function k(a,e,s,l,n,c){return r(!0),o(h,null,p(n.pageJSON,(i,m)=>(r(),o("div",v,[t("div",I,[t("div",b,[t("img",{src:"/assets/images/"+i.picture,id:i.imgID},null,8,_)]),t("div",{class:"details",onMousemove:e[0]||(e[0]=u=>c.cssVars(u))},[t("h2",null,d(i.title),1),t("p",null,d(i.blurb),1)],32)]),m!=n.pageJSON.length-1?(r(),o("hr",x)):w("",!0)]))),256)}const C=g(y,[["render",k],["__scopeId","data-v-78c0c153"]]);export{C as default};
