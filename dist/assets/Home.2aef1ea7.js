I'm passionate about video games, cartoons, anime, and technology. I'm a Linux and FOSS fanatic. I grew up in San Antonio, Texas. It's where I attained my education and spent most of my life. I've recently moved to California to live with my fianc\xE9e and her family. I'm looking towards joining the work force as a software developer. I have skills in fullstack web development, DevOps, game development, along with a solid understanding of the fundementals of computer science. I spent a lot of time programming in C in the quest for my degree. I'm quite a competent graphic designer if I do say myself. Before I decided to persue a degree in Computer Science I wanted to be an artist. Always looking forward towards expanding my knowledge and eager to make a name for myself."},{picture:"diploma.png",imgID:"diploma",title:"Bachelor's in Computer Science",blurb:"I achieved my degree at the University of Texas at San Antonio. It was a pleasant experience and I feel as my education was well rounded. I mainly spent my time learning core fundementals of computer science such as Data Structures, Discrete Mathmatics, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems using lower level languages such as C and C++. For concepts that required greater abstraction such as Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns there was Java. I learned and worked with MySQL in quite a few classes, including one dedicated to databases. I also spent some time with Python in a few courses as well as Game Development using C# in Unity. My last two semesters where pretty exclusively spent doing web development with JS, PHP, HTML, and CSS, along with the odd framework. Other languages I touched briefly where Lisp, awk, BASH, and x86 assembly."},{picture:"pfetch.png",imgID:"pfetch",title:"My experience with Linux",blurb:"Linux is a big part of my life. I first gained a fascination with the operating system in high school when I was trying to revive a hand-me-down laptop that orginally ran Windows Vista. After having to reinstall Vista several times because it would always result in an irrecoverable BSoD, I began looking for options and discovered Ubuntu. I believe it was release 11.04. I became obessed with the idea of a free alternative that allowed you do whatever with your system. Total freedom might come with the ability to break things, but I took it in stride. What really sold me was the customization options, not only within a given desktop environment, but what your desktop environment even was. Needless to say I spent a lot of time distro and environment hopping after that. I wanted to consume as much as I could, experience all the options out there. Nowadays I'm running EndeavourOS for my work and gaming machines configured using bspwm the tiling window manager."}];const u={data(){return{pageJSON:m}}},g={class:"content"},h={class:"flex-container"},p={class:"badge"},w=["src","id"],f={class:"details"},y={key:0};function v(I,b,_,k,i,S){return n(!0),a(d,null,l(i.pageJSON,(t,s)=>(n(),a("div",g,[e("div",h,[e("div",p,[e("img",{src:"/assets/images/"+t.picture,id:t.imgID},null,8,w)]),e("div",f,[e("h2",null,o(t.title),1),e("p",null,o(t.blurb),1)])]),s!=i.pageJSON.length-1?(n(),a("hr",y)):c("",!0)]))),256)}const D=r(u,[["render",v],["__scopeId","data-v-d7353f22"]]);export{D as default};
